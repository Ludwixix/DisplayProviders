# Suppliers List
## Summary

This webpart displays supplier data which is pulled form a SharePoint list. It then processes the data, seperating it into supplier types which are displayed on the left hand column.

When a supplier type is selected from the left hand column, all market vendors that fall under that type are displayed.

Clicking on a market vendor will then display the supplier details.
