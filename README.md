## Summary

This webpart displays supplier data in an intuitive and user friendly format. 

The suppliers are categorized into types.

When a type is selected from the left hand column, all market vendors that fall under that type are displayed.

Clicking on a market vendor will then display the supplier details.

This data is pulled from a SharePoint list which can be easily modified and updated.
